title: About me
---

I am an engineering researcher turned bioinformatician passionate about teaching and training!

I am currently a bioinformatics training focussed postdoctoral researcher at University of California Davis, where I develop and test technical documentation on broad topics including bioinformatics, cloud computing and data reusability for the [NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem](https://nih-cfde.org/).

I received my PhD at the [Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering at University of Florida](https://mae.ufl.edu). My dissertation research was focussed on understanding the cellular mechanisms associated with primary blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI), which is a common concern among military personnel. My thesis work earned **Best Dissertation Award** in the Solid Mechanics, Design and Manufacturing track.

My first postdoctoral experience was at the [Department of Neurosciences at University of California San Diego](https://medschool.ucsd.edu/som/neurosciences/Pages/default.aspx) where I worked with transcriptomics and proteomic data from subjects with Alzheimer's Disease. I developed a sorting algorithm to better categorize patients, assessed clinical and phenotype correlations along with exploration of multiple enrichment analyses.

Apart from scientific contributions, one of the most rewarding experiences for me has been to teach bioinformatics and coding skills. I am a certified [Software Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org) & [Data Carpentries](https://datacarpentry.org) [Instructor](https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/) having taught workshops on various topics including R, git, UNIX, and conda.
